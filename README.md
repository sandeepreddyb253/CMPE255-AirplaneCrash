# 1) Project title - Statistics of airplane crash data 
 
# 2) What data you’ll use and where you’ll get it? 
https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?query=Airplane%20Crashes&docid=GUhYyjK%2B7677nVD6AAAAAA%3D%3D 
This dataset contains a full history of airplane crashes from 1908 to present which resulted in deaths throughout the world from civil, military, aviation, etc. 
 
 
# 3)Description of the problem you’ll solve or the question you’ll investigate. 
-> Yearly how many planes crashed? How many people were on board? How many survived? How many died? 
-> Highest number of crashes by operator and Type of aircrafts. 
-> ‘Summary’ field has the details about the crashes. Find the reasons of the crash and categorize them in different clusters i.e Fire, shot down, weather (for the ‘Blanks’  in the data category can be UNKNOWN) you are open to make clusters of your choice but they should not exceed 7. 
-> Find the number of crashed aircrafts and number of deaths against each category from the above step. 
-> Find any interesting trends/behaviors that you encounter when you analyze the dataset. 

# 4) Potential methods you will consider apply (these can change as you play with the data). 
-> Association – Apriori Algorithm 
-> Clustering Analysis - K- Means Clustering Algorithm 
-> Sequential Patterns or Pattern Tracking - Generalized Sequential Pattern algorithm. 

# 5)  How will you measure success? 
Modelling will be done for various parameters and models will be trained with train data and testing will be done for test data and accuracy, mean square error will be calculated and success will be determined based on how the model is behaving.
